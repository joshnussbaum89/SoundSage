# Ear Training App

Why the fuck am I making this?

My school closed. I care about my school. I fucking loved UArts. It wasn't perfect, but it was an amazing place that taught me incredible things. Among these positive experiences were revelatory moments of musical growth. I want to try to put some of that ear training and training material to use so that others can share in the magic of that school and what they taught.

This app is dedicated to UArts. It is a free tool that I can fund with Patreon, donations, etc. A percentage of all earning go to arts education programs. Full transparency about fundraising + reporting.
